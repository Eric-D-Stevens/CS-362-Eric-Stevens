refactor.txt - Eric Stevens

This file contains a summary of the refactoring of the switching statement.

Individual functions were coppied out of the switch statment to the bottome of dominion.c.

The functions take the pointers to the gamestate.

The functions take the values of other variables from the CardEffect function by refernce.

Since the implementations in each case of the switch statement returns a value, the functions return the 
same value as the case would have, and the case in the switch statements return the function call.

Here are the functions that were refactored:
	1. case: smithy > SmithyCard()
	2. case: great_hall > GreatHallCard()
	3. case: minion > MinionCard()
	4. case: sea_hag > SeaHagCard()
	5. case: embargo > EmbargoCard()

All the fuction declarations can be found at the bottom of the dominion.h file. The function definitions
can be found at the bottom of the dominion.c file. The calls to the refactored functions can be found in 
switch statment in place of the old cases. Cases were commeted out in place to leave a reference.
